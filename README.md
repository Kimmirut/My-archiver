# My archiver

My archiver is a simple educational project
to improve my programming skills.
I'm gonna implement different compression alogrythms
and compare their results.


## Roadmap

I'm gonna divide development into several steps:

0. Implement and find out the best way to compress data.

1. Creating a python library that allows you to archive files
and act like a Console app

2. Creating GUI for that library to wrap console app, thus get
a desktop app

3. Creating an WEB-page of project, where you can use and qdownload it
